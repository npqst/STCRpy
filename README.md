Structural TCR python (STCRpy) is a software suite for analysing and processing T-cell receptor structures.

# Installation

## TL;DR installation
```
pip install stcrpy
pip install plip
conda install -c conda-forge pymol-open-source  numpy -y
ANARCI --build_models           # this step will take a few minutes
```

## Step by step installation
We recommend installing STCRpy in a [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install#macos-linux-installation) (or [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html)) environment using python 3.9 to 3.12: 
```
conda create -n stcrpy_env python==3.12 -y
conda activate stcrpy_env
```

The core functionality of STCRpy can be installed as follows:
```
pip install stcrpy
```

After installing stcrpy, the anarci HMM models must be built to enable annotation.
```
ANARCI --build_models           # this step will take a few minutes
```

To enable interaction profiling, install PLIP (Adasme et. al., 2021):
```
pip install plip
```

To enable pymol visualisations, install pymol open source locally within the environment. Unfortunately, pymol currently needs to be installed even if you already have a pymol version. Be sure to install pymol within a managed conda (or mamba) environment to prevent interference with any existing versions. 
```
conda install -c conda-forge pymol-open-source -y
```

To generate pytorch and pytorch-geometric compatible datasets (see the [pytorch docs](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for hardware specific instructions): 
```
pip install stcrpy[ml_datasets]
```

> Note that the installs for pytorch can be platform specific.
> If errors are ecountered here it is best to manually install the depedencies following the [pytorch installation docs](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
> For example:
> ```
> pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
> pip install torch_geometric
> ```
> This installs the CPU version of pytorch (for GPU / CUDA versions follow the install [pytorch installation docs](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)).
>
> The EGNN example also uses `einops`. Which can be manually installed as follows:
> ```
> pip install einops
> ```

# Documentation
STCRpy [documentation](https://stcrpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is hosted on ReadtheDocs.

# Examples
STCRpy generates and operates on TCR structure objects. The majority of the API can be accessed through functions of the format: `tcr.some_stcrpy_function()`. ([See TCR object docs here](https://stcrpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stcrpy.tcr_processing.html#stcrpy.tcr_processing.TCR.TCR)). TCR objects are associated with their MHC and antigen if these are presented in the structure. 

A notebook with examples can be found under [examples/STCRpy_examples.ipynb](./examples/STCRpy_examples.ipynb)

First import STCRpy:
```
import stcrpy
```

### To fetch a TCR structure from STCRDab or the PDB: 
```
multiple_tcrs = stcrpy.fetch_TCRs("8gvb")
```
This will return a list of all of the TCR structures found in the PDB file, represented as TCR structure objects.

### To load a TCR structure from a PDB or MMCIF file:
```
tcr = stcrpy.load_TCR("filename.{pdb, cif}")
```

### To load multiple TCR structures from a list of files at once:
```
multiple_tcrs = stcrpy.load_TCRs([file_1, file_2, file_3])
```

### To save a TCR object to PDB or MMCIF files: 
```
tcr.save(filename.{pdb, cif})           # save the TCR and it's associated MHC and antigen
tcr.save(filename.{pdb, cif}, TCR_only=True)           # save the TCR only
```

### To calculate the TCR to pMHC geometry:
```
tcr.calculate_geometry()            # change the 'mode' keyword argument to change the geometry calculation method. See paper / documentation for details.
```

### To score the TCR to pMHC geometry:
```
tcr.score_docking_geometry()
```

### To profile interactions: 
```
tcr.profile_peptide_interactions()          # interaction profiling parameters can be adjusted, see documentation for details
```

### To visualise interactions:
```
tcr.visualise_interactions()
```

### To run full analysis on a set of TCR structures: 
```
from stcrpy.tcr_methods.tcr_batch_operations import analyse_tcrs
germlines_and_alleles_df, geometries_df, interactions_df = analyse_tcrs(list_or_dict_of_files)
```

### To generate graph datasets:
```
dataset = TCRGraphDataset(
            root=PATH_TO_DATASET,
            data_paths=PATH_TO_TCR_FILES
        )
```

### To calculate TCR prediction metrics such as RMSD, interface RMSD (of the TCR:pMHC interface) or DockQ scores:

```
# RMSD
from stcrpy.tcr_metrics import RMSD

rmsd_calculator = RMSD()
rmsd = rmsd_calculator.calculate_rmsd(pred_tcr, reference_tcr, save_alignment=False)      # Calculates the RMSD of each region of the TCR. To check the alignment set save_alignment to True.

# To calculate RMSD for a set of predictions against a set of reference structures from files: 
files = list(zip(prediction_files, reference_files))
rmsd_df = rmsd_calculator.rmsd_from_files(files)



# Interface RMSD of TCR:pMHC interface
from stcrpy.tcr_metrics import InterfaceRMSD

interface_rmsd_calculator = InterfaceRMSD()
irmsds = interface_rmsd_calculator.get_interface_rmsd(tcr, reference_tcr)

# DockQ
from stcrpy.tcr_metrics.tcr_dockq import TCRDockQ

dockq_calculator = TCRDockQ()               # by default this will merge the TCR and pMHC chains and calculate DockQ of the complete TCR:pMHC interface. To calculate DockQ scores per chain, use TCR_pMHC_interface=False
dockq_results = dockq_calculator.tcr_dockq(tcr, reference_tcr, save_merged_complex=False)           # to investigate the merged TCR:pMHC structure set save_merged_complex=True 

```
